## spacesavers2_usurp

This takes in the TSV file generated by `spacesavers2_grubbers` and a hash from its first column to:

- find the row corresponding to the hash
- keep one copy as of the duplicates as "original copy"
- delete other copies and replace them with hard (or soft) links

Deleting these high-value duplicates has the biggest impact on the users overall digital footprint.

### Inputs

- `--grubber` output file from `spacesavers2_grubbers`.
- `--hash` a hash from its first column of the grubber TSV.
- `--force` (OPTIONAL) if the duplicates are cross-device then hard links cannot be made, with `--force` you can force using sym-links instead.

```bash
usage: spacesavers2_usurp [-h] -g GRUBBER -x HASH [-f | --force | --no-force]

spacesavers2_usurp: delete all but one copy of the file matching the hash and replace all other copies with hardlinks

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g GRUBBER, --grubber GRUBBER
                        spacesavers2_grubbers output TSV file
  -x HASH, --hash HASH  hash (or unique partial hash) from column 1 of spacesavers2_grubbers TSV file
  -f, --force, --no-force
                        forcefully create symlink if hardlink is not possible

Version:
    v0.8
Example:
    > spacesavers2_usurp -g grubbers.TSV -h someHash
```

### Outputs

On screen confirmation that the duplicates are replaced with hard (or soft) links.
